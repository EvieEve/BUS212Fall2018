For overnight parking on the street, most parking spaces are reserved for residents or valet parking zones. 4.There is also an indoor garage near the Fleet center called the North End Garage. 5.Meter maids are notorious in the North End.

If you avoid morning and after work commutes, the rates are usually between $4 - $9, but can be more during surge periods. Taking public transportation from here will cost at least $1.70 per person in bus fare (if you have a Charlie Card, explained below) and usually involves a transfer (free), so it can be a little complicated for visitors and doesn't save you that much compared to UberPool or Lyft Line.   If you are planning on using public transportation while here, which can be a good idea when you are travelling between areas accessible by the T (our subway), we suggest that you get a Charlie Card. They are hard plastic cards that you can store value on and use to pay for T and bus fares. Additionally, the fares are discounted compared to paying cash or getting one time passes ($2.25 vs $2.75 for the T, $1.70 vs. $2.00 for bus). You can pick up a Charlie Card at any major T stop.

Taking public transportation from here will cost at least $1.70 per person in bus fare (if you have a Charlie Card, explained below) and usually involves a transfer (free), so it can be a little complicated for visitors and doesn't save you that much compared to UberPool or Lyft Line.   If you are planning on using public transportation while here, which can be a good idea when you are travelling between areas accessible by the T (our subway), we suggest that you get a Charlie Card. They are hard plastic cards that you can store value on and use to pay for T and bus fares. Additionally, the fares are discounted compared to paying cash or getting one time passes ($2.25 vs $2.75 for the T, $1.70 vs. $2.00 for bus). You can pick up a Charlie Card at any major T stop.

For overnight parking on the street, most parking spaces are reserved for residents or valet parking zones. 4.There is also an indoor garage near the Fleet center called the North End Garage. 5.Meter maids are notorious in the North End.

It's about a 12-15 minute walk from either one of these stations to the house. The cost of these two trains is about the same - approximately $2.50 per person one way - and while the Commuter Rail trains are more expeditious, the Red Line trains run more frequently than do the Commuter Rail trains.
